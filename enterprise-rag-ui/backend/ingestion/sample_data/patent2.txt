        Patent Title: Improved Vector Database for Information Retrieval
        
        Abstract:
        An improved vector database system for efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional vector embeddings. The system uses novel indexing structures to enable fast similarity search across billions of vectors with minimal memory footprint.
        
        Background:
        Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store and query high-dimensional vector embeddings. These embeddings are commonly used in machine learning applications, particularly for semantic search and recommendation systems.
        
        Description:
        The improved vector database uses a hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) graph structure combined with product quantization to enable efficient approximate nearest neighbor search. The system includes a distributed architecture that allows horizontal scaling across multiple nodes while maintaining query performance.
