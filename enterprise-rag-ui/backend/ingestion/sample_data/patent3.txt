        Patent Title: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks
        
        Abstract:
        A system and method for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that enhances large language model outputs with relevant information retrieved from external knowledge sources. The system improves factual accuracy and reduces hallucinations in AI-generated content.
        
        Background:
        Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating human-like text. However, they often produce factually incorrect information or "hallucinations" when dealing with knowledge-intensive tasks that require specific information not captured in their parameters.
        
        Description:
        The RAG system comprises three main components: (1) a retriever that identifies relevant documents from a knowledge corpus based on the input query, (2) an encoder that converts the retrieved documents into a format suitable for the language model, and (3) a generator that produces the final output by conditioning on both the input query and the retrieved information.
