        Patent Title: Method and System for Natural Language Processing
        
        Abstract:
        A method and system for natural language processing that uses machine learning techniques to understand and generate human language. The system includes a neural network trained on large text corpora to recognize patterns in language and generate contextually appropriate responses.
        
        Background:
        Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of human languages in a valuable way.
        
        Description:
        The system comprises a multi-layer neural network architecture with attention mechanisms that allow it to focus on relevant parts of input text when generating responses. The system is trained using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques on diverse text datasets.
